\begin{frame}{How much own-account work (OAW) is constrained?}

\pause \textbf{Motivation:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In developing countries, 27\% of urban employed population are OAWs.
  \item Complex category: some are true entrepreneurs, some are constrained.
\end{itemize} \pause

\textbf{Questions:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Why do people take up OAW when mean income is below employees'?
  \item Why is OAW much more prevalent in poor regions?
  \item Among OAWs, how many are constrained?
\end{enumerate} \pause

\textbf{Our proposition:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explore the time trade-off between \hl{OAW now} vs. \hl{better paid job later}.
\end{itemize} \pause

\fbox{\parbox{.95\textwidth}{\centering \emph{People may choose OAW because they have urgent consumption needs and can't afford to wait for a good job sometime in the future.}}}

\textbf{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{Step 1}} Incorporate OAW in a very simple job search framework:}

\begin{equation*}
\text{\hl{\textit{OAW is chosen if}}} \quad y > b + \frac{\lambda}{\delta + \rho} \cdot \int_{w_r}^{\infty} \Big( w - w_r \Big) \, dF(w)
\end{equation*}

\pause
\begin{itemize}
  \item OAW is more frequent where present value of looking for a job is lower.
  \item Low-pay OAW can be optimal if jobs are scarce and consumption is urgent.
\end{itemize} \medskip \pause

\textbf{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{Step 2}} Estimate the labor market parameters using survey data for Brazil:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If I were to look for a job, how much could I expect to earn?
  \item For how long would I need to search? How long would such job last?
\end{itemize} \medskip \pause

\textbf{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{Step 3}} Infer the subjective time discount from the observed choice:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item By revealed preference, infer for all Brazilian own-account workers the lowest discount rate ($\rho$) that makes such occupation prefereable.
\end{itemize}

		\textbf{Implication:} \bigskip
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Many rational workers can be \hl{stuck in low-pay OAW} given frictional job market, contrained finance, urgent consumption.

\begin{frame}{Appendix:}{Valuation equations in the extended job search model}

\begin{align*}
\text{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{\textbf{Wage employment}}}} & \quad \rho \cdot W(w) = w + \delta \cdot \Big( U - W(w) \Big) \phantom{\int} \\
& \\
\text{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{\textbf{Unemployment}}}} & \quad  \rho \cdot U = b + \lambda \cdot \int_{w_r}^{\infty} \Big( W(w) - U \Big) \, dF(w) \\
& \\
\text{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{\textbf{Reservation wage}}}} & \quad w_r = b + \frac{\lambda}{\delta + \rho} \cdot \int_{w_r}^{\infty} \Big( w - w_r \Big) \, dF(w) 
& \\
& \\
\text{\textcolor{main-color}{\fbox{\textbf{Own-account work}}}} & \quad \rho \cdot \mathit{OAW} = y 
\end{align*}

\end{frame} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Appendix:}{The occupational decision from the perspective of the discount rate}

\begin{equation*}
\rho > \frac{\lambda}{y - b} \cdot \int_{w_r}^{\infty} \big( w - w_r \big) \, dF(w) - \delta
\end{equation*} 

\textbf{What is this?}
\begin{itemize}
\item The (right-hand side) \hl{minimum discount rate} that justifies the choice for OAW, given the individual productivity and the labor market conditions.
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{How is this useful?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Formalization of the idea that a sufficiently high urgency for consumption (i.e. the "necessity") can rationalize the choice for OAW \hl{for any value of $y$}.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Appendix:}{The building blocks of the structural model}

\begin{gather*}
\rho > \frac{\lambda}{y - b} \cdot \int_{w_r}^{\infty} \big( w - w_r \big) \, dF(w) - \delta \\
\downarrow \\
\hat{\rho}_i > \frac{\mathbb{E} \left( \lambda \,|\, X_i \right)}{y_i - \mathbb{E} \left( b \,|\, X_i \right)} \cdot \Big[ \mathbb{E}\left( w \,|\, w > w_r, X_i \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( w_r \,|\, X_i \right) \cdot \mathbb{P}(w \geq w_r) \Big] - \mathbb{E} \left( \delta \,|\, X_i \right)
\end{gather*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \hl{$y_i$} is directly observable for own-account workers. 
\item \hl{$\mathbb{E} \left(\lambda \,|\, X_i \right)$} is fit with an unemp. duration model and with $\mathbb{P} (w \geq w_r)$. 
\item \hl{$\mathbb{E} \left(b \,|\, X_i \right)$} is assumed to be zero, the most frequent value. 
\item \hl{$\mathbb{E} \left( w \,|\, w > w_r, X_i \right)$} is fit with a Heckman selection model.  
\item \hl{$\mathbb{E} \left( w_r \,|\, X_i \right)$} is fit with a quantile regression at the 10th centile. 
\item \hl{$\mathbb{P} (w \geq w_r)$} is calculated for a normal distribution of wages. 
\item \hl{$\mathbb{E} \left(\delta \,|\, X_i \right)$} is fit with a job duration model.
\end{enumerate}
